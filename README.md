# a story about my development process and problem-solving strategy.

* First I have read and understood the steps to do this project.
* second I have opened my laPtop  then I install all the  **Pre requirement for the project(Tool used to build project)**
* then I created a repository on my **Githhub account** next I copy the link repreprestory that I have created to make a clone of it on My Local computer by use GitBach command **Git (Local repository)** and I opened the file
by  user**Git Bach** Text Editor **Visual studio**.
* I have created 3 files  in folder the first file was  **HTML** , second **CCS** and **Javascript** then I link second **CCS** and **Javascript**  To  HTML File by command of **HTML** .

*Hint for beginners in development **HTML** and **CCS** is Static Side of the Webpage and  **Javascript** it is an interactive side of a webpage with a user.

## third I have started to write a story of **Connect4 Game**  how designed this webpage 
* first I have drawn simple designed for the interface on my notebook then I take a look on this game 
of the application was built before and I play on it to understand behavior, logic of this game and to make a senes;
* second I have started to build **HTML** and **CCS**  webpage as draw it on a notebook.
* third I have put the plan for this webpage how to make it interactive with a user by use **Javascript**.
* forth I have started coding to test if the plan is it working or not.
## step of coding to build this program.

* First i create variables that to access to the HTML Elements by using the  **Ducoment Object Modle(DOM)**.

* second i create arrays variables.
* third  I have put each column in an array to deal to apply the logic that I put it.
* i create  one event Listener for all columns 
*  I apply the Logic to switch between the two user 
             
``` if(pleyer==1){   
               
        culumn1arry[columnCounter1].classList.add("player1");
                 pleyer=0;
                 columnCounter1--;
               console.log("redcolor");
               checkWin()             
 }  
              
else  if(pleyer==0){   
  culumn1arry[columnCounter1].classList.add("player2")
          pleyer=1;
          columnCounter1--;
           ```
 this is the end step

*  then I apply the logic to that to know who is  the winner  player1 or player 2 and put or no one of the winner.
